Title: Simple Banking Application in Java

Description:
I recently developed a Simple Banking Application in Java that offers essential banking functionalities. This application allows users to perform common banking tasks such as depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and checking their account balance.

Key Features:
1. Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their account by entering the desired deposit amount.
2.Withdraw: Users can withdraw funds from their account, provided they have sufficient balance, by specifying the withdrawal amount.
3. Check Balance: Users can inquire about their account balance at any time.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The application offers a straightforward menu-driven interface, making it easy for users to navigate and perform transactions.
5. Input Validation: Input validation ensures that users enter valid numeric values for amounts and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
6. Robust Error Handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to deal with various scenarios, such as invalid inputs and insufficient balances during withdrawals.

This Simple Banking Application serves as a foundational project for understanding basic Java programming concepts like user input, conditional statements, loops, and method implementation. It can be further extended and enhanced with additional features like transaction history, user authentication, and graphical user interface (GUI) integration.

Feel free to explore and enhance this codebase according to your requirements.
